# Books

A book library application.

## Tools

  1. **ReactJS**
  2. **Semantic UI** looks better than *Bootstrap*, has nice components and seems to be much cleaner and modular.
  3. There is no need for a build tool. *NPM* or *Webpack* can accomplish the same tasks. **Gulp** seem to have a better implementation than *Grunt*, is the default build tools of *Semantic-UI*. *Grunt* seems to disappear.
  4. **Sass** has better approach for development and delivery. Only the required components will be included in the stylesheet. It works well with legacy css too.
  5. **Babel** to use with ES6 and NPM packages.
  6. **Webpack** to manage the assets and get started fast. *NPM* can do most of the grunt work, but it will require additional configuration. *Bower* isn't necessary when you can compile *NPM* modules.

## Installation

  1. Run `gem install` to install gem dependencies.
  2. Run `npm install` to install JS dependencies.
  3. Configure the `NODE_ENV` environment variable, to *development* (default) or *production*. You can also run `./.profile`.
